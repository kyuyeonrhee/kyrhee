### Research
<br>
<br>
I am interested in analyzing unstructured data and conducting empirical research. My interests lie in Social Media and Health Analytics.
<br>
<br>
In my master's thesis, I examined the relationship between the content of video reviews and their popularity on YouTube by conducting sentiment analysis. My proceedings paper about the same subject has been accepted to [KrAIS](https://sites.google.com/site/kraisweb/2019-krais-research-workshop?authuser=0), a post-ICIS conference upcoming this December.
