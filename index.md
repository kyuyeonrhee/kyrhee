### Research
I am interested in analyzing unstructured data and conducting empirical research. My interests lie in social media and healthcare data.

In my master's thesis, I examined the relationship between the content of video reviews and their popularity on YouTube by conducting sentiment analysis. My proceedings paper about the same subject has been accepted to [KrAIS](https://sites.google.com/site/kraisweb/2019-krais-research-workshop?authuser=0), a post-ICIS conference upcoming this December.


### Teaching

I was a teaching assistant in two undergraduate courses, two graduate courses, and three MBA courses. These courses include:

- Technological Innovation and Business Redesign
- Topics in Management Information Systems
- Information Systems Development Seminar
