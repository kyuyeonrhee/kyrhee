### Research Interests
<br>
<br>
I have been focusing on user-generated data found on social channels. I believe that new perspectives on business strategies and innovations can be generated by exploring value creation in these networks, notably in online communities where effective collaboration occurs at an unprecedented scale. In my master's thesis, I examined the relationship between the content of video reviews and their popularity on YouTube by conducting sentiment analysis. My proceedings paper about the same subject has been accepted to [KrAIS](https://sites.google.com/site/kraisweb/2019-krais-research-workshop?authuser=0), a post-ICIS conference in December 2019.

Recently, I am interested in online healthcare communities where IT artifacts connect geographically distant people and patient-driven innovations are incubated. In my future research, I aspire to identify effective design rules that drive user engagement in online communities.
