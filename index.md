I am a graduate student majoring in Business Administration at Seoul National University. I am planning to graduate and receive my master's at February 2020, with a focus on Information Systems.<br>


My research interests lie in social media, user-generated content, and analyzing unstructured data. In my master's thesis, I examined the relationship between the content of video reviews and their popularity on YouTube by conducting sentiment analysis. I found that the amount of the sentiment embedded in the reviewer's speech contributes to the popularity of a video review.
